# Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1.  One player (Player 1) enters a secret word or phrase.
2.  Another player (Player 2) tries to guess the letters in the word or phrase.
3.  Player 2 has a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives) before the hangman is fully drawn.
4.  If Player 2 guesses all the letters in the word or phrase before running out of lives, they win! Otherwise, Player 1 wins.

## Running the Game

To play the game, simply run the `hangman_student.py` script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python hangman_student.py
```
```

I will now create a file named `README.md` in your current directory with this content.
